<div><p>MyLab@T1442 happened to be formally one of School of Design's Diploma in Visual Media Design Studio. From the 9 seconds video capture, briefly we can see MyLab@T1442 is very well organized with one classroom,  one meeting area, one practical/ project room which are equipped with one Universal VLSLaser Machine, several 3D printers, PCB Milling Machines, drills for making PCB, SMT component soldering  stations, and also Osillosopes to measure the waveform and cuircuit testing</p>
<p>For the next 6 months starting 15 January 2017, MyLab@T1442 will be our battle field. Here we come, Fabacademy Class of 2017.</p>
