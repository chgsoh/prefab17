         <p>Hi, My name is HG. I'm from SP Design School. My duties in the school involves administration of various school systems, operation as well as studios management. I was informed about Fabacademy Diploma by my Reporting Officer, Senior Manager and Director</p><br>
<p>I understand that this is a tough programme which aim to teach the participants how to build almost anything. A handful of SP staffs have benefited from this course and have joined the big family of Fabacademy community which spread across the globe.</p><br>
<p>Through this wonderful course that teaches the participants projects management skills, good practices and knowledge to building almost anything, I am hoping to acquire enough knowledge to enable me to build something useful for my own and hopefully will able to gain the capability to provide guidance to our students in the near future.</p>
